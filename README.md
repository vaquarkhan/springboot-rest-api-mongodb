# Campaigns REST API example
This is a simple example how you can use spring boot + mongodb + docker to create a rest api. Any suggestions, new features or corrections are welcome!

- [x] Spring Boot
- [x] Spring Data
- [x] MongoDB 
- [x] Log4j2 (instead of logback)
- [x] Docker
- [x] Swagger 2 (api documentation)
- [x] CORS filter
- [x] Unit Tests
- [x] Integration Tests

**System requirements**
- JDK 11
- Maven
- Docker

## API documentation 
This example uses Swagger 2. Access http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to check the documentation.

## Build and run application
The file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) contains all the necessary settings to configure the environemnt. As this is a very simple application, we will basically have only two containers/services - the rest api and the database. If you want to  build or rebuild services to include any code changes in the docker image(s), run `docker-compose build`. To start all the services, you need to run `docker-compose up` (use `-d` to run in detached mode). The docker image for the rest api application service is defined by the file [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) using multi stages in order to build and execute the application.

                     docker-compose build
                     Docker-compose up -d --build

If you prefer not to use docker, you can manually build and generate the executable file with `mvn clean package` and then run the maven spring boot plugin (`mvn spring-boot:run`) or directly the java command `java -jar <jar file location>`. Do not forget to set the required environment variables for the [application.properties](/src/main/resources/application.properties). You must be running an instance of MongoDB server.

The rest api application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

Enjoy!
